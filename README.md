# CS 221: Computer Science II — Boise State University

This repository contains my assignments and projects for **CS 221: Computer Science II**.  
Each folder represents a different assignment or lab focused on Java programming, debugging, and algorithm analysis.

---

## Assignment Overview

### GridMonitor
A Java program that **reads input data** and constructs a **2D array** from it.  
Used to analyze grid data and perform calculations across a dataset.

---

### Debug
A collection of code snippets containing **three intentional bugs**.  
The goal was to **identify, document, and fix** each issue using the Java debugger.

---

### FormatChecker
A Java file that validates the **format of input files**.  
Ensures there are no incorrect data types (strings, doubles, missing, or extra data)  
When files are read via the command line.

---

### AoA (Analysis of Algorithms)
Contains small Java methods used to analyze **algorithm efficiency** and complexity.  
Also includes a Word document explaining the assignment and results.

---

### Lists1
Contains a planning `.txt` file outlining **test scenarios** for future implementation in `ListTester.java`.

---

### Lists2
Implements the **ListTester** described in `lists1`.  
Tests are run against:
- `GoodList.java` → passes most tests  
- `BadList.java` → fails most tests (for debugging and analysis)

---

### ArrayList
Implements a **custom ArrayList** class that provides dynamic array-based list behavior.  
Focuses on indexing, resizing, and supporting list operations efficiently.  
Tested using multiple list scenarios through the `ListTester` framework.

---

### SingleLinkedList
Implements a **singly linked list** structure using node-based connections.  
Covers pointer manipulation, traversal logic, and iterator handling.  
Emphasizes proper memory management and reference updating during add/remove operations.

---

### DoubleLinkedList
Implements a **doubly linked list** with both forward and backward traversal capabilities.  
Supports efficient insertion and removal at both ends.  
Extensively tested using the `ListTester` to ensure iterator correctness and list integrity.

---

### Mergesort
Implemented a generic Merge Sort algorithm in Java for custom indexed lists using both 
Comparable and Comparator-based sorting with O(n log n) runtime.
  
---

### CircuitTracer

Built a Java circuit pathfinding app using DFS and BFS to compute and display the 
shortest valid paths from file-based board layouts.
